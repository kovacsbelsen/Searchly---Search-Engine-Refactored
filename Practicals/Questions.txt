Questions for Sergio for meeting 1:
1. Javadcs and test classes, we can not generate javadocs for test classes, should that be included?
2. Should all tests be in one class? or seperate classes?
3. Should methods be public? 
4. Where should we display message, editing pages will cause uni tests to fail and
     js seems like and odd exercise.
